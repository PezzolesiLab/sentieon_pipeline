# Explanation

You need a config file to run the pipeline. You can create a new one if you'd like, or you can use one of these. The config file MUST be named `nextflow.config` and must be in the same directory as the `sentieon.nf` file. So you'll need to rename and move one of these files in order to run the pipeline.

For example, you'll have to do something similar to the following:

`mv ./configs/demux.config ./nextflow.config`
